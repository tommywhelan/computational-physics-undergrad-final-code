# computational-physics-undergrad-final-code
The final code to my undergrad course in computational physics.

The code simulates N particles in a three dimensional potential well. Once the simulation runs, several physical questions can be answered, including how many particles escaped the potential well and how fast the particles are going.

Definitely not perfect code, but wanted to put it up as it was one of my first major coding endeavors
